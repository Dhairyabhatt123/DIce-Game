A simple and interactive dice game built with React. The objective of the game is to select a number between 1 and 6, roll the dice, and update the score based on whether the rolled number matches the selected number.

Roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.

If the rolled number matches your selected number, your score will increase by that number.

If the rolled number does not match your selected number, your score will decrease by that number.

The game continues with each roll, and the score updates accordingly!
